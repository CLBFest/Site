# CL+ B Fest

## Home
On March 16-18, 2018, the first annual Computational Law & Blockchain Festival will bring together coders, designers, lawyers, policymakers, researchers, and students from around the world to co-create the future of law, legal practice, and policymaking.

This global initiative will be a push to create and implement computational law and legal blockchain use cases. We will achieve this through a combination of educational sessions, hackathons, and policy discussions. In the spirit of decentralization, this entire event is hosted by independent, self-organized nodes around the world. Join us so you can LEARN, BUILD, and DISCUSS:

This global initiative will be a push to create and implement computational law and legal blockchain use cases. We will achieve this through a combination of educational sessions, hackathons, and policy discussions. In the spirit of decentralization, this entire event is hosted by independent, self-organized nodes around the world. Join us so you can LEARN, BUILD, and DISCUSS:

* **LEARN:** New to computational law or blockchain technologies? Learn the basics from local and global experts at our educational sessions.

* **BUILD:** Are you a coder or designer? Come test your hacking skills on one of our global challenges. Opportunities for local and global awards for winners!

* **DISCUSS:** What's the appropriate role of government in the blockchain ecosystem? Are ICOs securities offerings? What are the benefits and drawbacks of computational law for the legal system and society? How can we promote a welcoming and diverse blockchain community? Let's discuss!

The Festival welcomes enthusiasts of all ages, genders, backgrounds, skill levels, and disciplines, and will be free to attend and participate.  If you would like to host a Festival node in your city, fill out the information in our Google Form by January 19, 2018.

### Project Tracks

#### SUBSTANTIVE TRACK 1 - SMART LEGAL CONTRACTS

| *Name of Challenge* | *Description/Purpose - Use Case* | 
|------------------|--------------|
| Smart Contract Formation and Execution Challenge | Smart legal contracts can improve upon existing contracting practices by incorporating external data sources to provide real-time status about the performance of obligations and automating various legal, business, and operational practices such as giving notice of breach, issuing an invoice, and making payment. The challenge is to draft and execute a smart legal contract that is connected to data and software systems in order to address a legal or business problem in areas that may include supply chain, employment, professional services (including service levels), media/entertainment, fundraising, or real estate. Presented by the Accord Project and OpenLaw. | 
| Smart Contract Dispute Resolution Challenge |Smart contracts face challenges--there are coding errors and security vulnerabilities; users will need to make changes, terminate contracts, and dispute transactions. Contracting parties will have disputes with different disputed amounts, in different industries, and with different sensitivities or concerns. The challenge is to define a type of dispute you believe will become prevalent in the smart contract space and create a dispute resolution solution or process for smart contract users of that type. The solution will sit on an infrastructure-level dispute resolution marketplace. Challenge presented by Bootstrap Legal.|

#### SUBSTANTIVE TRACK 2 - BLOCKCHAIN FOR LEGAL USE CASES

| *Name of Challenge* | *Description/Purpose - Use Case* | 
|-----------|--------|
| Digital Identity Challenge |Develop a solution to enable enforceable blockchain-based digital signatures to grant or revoke consent and authorization for electronic transactions on the open web. |
| LawChain Challenge | Develop a killer blockchain app to liberate law as verifiable, standard open data may also hold the key to render law understandable and usable by people, groups and organizations. |
| Small Business Crowdfunding Challenge | Develop open toolkits for companies, lawyers and developers using blockchain technology to make crowdfunding cheaper, easier and more useful for local businesses.This challenge continues the project https://github.com/ngk2017/ncfunderhack. Activities include: (1) Policy, systemic and legal issue development suitable for lawyers of any technical skill level. (2) Legal operations specifications development: what are the critical blockchain solutions that will enable small business crowdfunding? (3) Coding a “thing” small businesses can use: we will build CryptoKitties-style “aliens” while exploring legal significance of the game functions. |

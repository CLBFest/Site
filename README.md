# CL+ B Fest

![clbfest](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10615650/34959250-b2a35ae0-fa03-11e7-8a86-55426116c784.png)


On March 16-18, 2018, the first annual Computational Law & Blockchain Festival will bring together coders, designers, lawyers, policymakers, researchers, and students from around the world to co-create the future of law, legal practice, and policymaking.

This global initiative will be a push to create and implement computational law and legal blockchain use cases. We will achieve this through a combination of educational sessions, hackathons, and policy discussions. In the spirit of decentralization, this entire event is hosted by independent, self-organized nodes around the world. Join us so you can LEARN, BUILD, and DISCUSS:

* **LEARN:** New to computational law or blockchain technologies? Learn the basics from local and global experts at our educational sessions.

* **HACK:** Are you a coder or designer? Come test your hacking skills on one of our global challenges. Opportunities for local and global awards for winners!

* **DISCUSS:** What's the appropriate role of government in the blockchain ecosystem? Are ICOs securities offerings? What are the benefits and drawbacks of computational law for the legal system and society? How can we promote a welcoming and diverse blockchain community? Let's discuss!

The Festival welcomes enthusiasts of all ages, genders, backgrounds, skill levels, and disciplines, and will be free to attend and participate. *#clbfest2018*

## Festival Streams

**STREAM 1: LEARN** 
Each node of the Computational Law & Blockchain Festival will include an educational track focused on education about blockchain and smart contracts and workshops for skill-building.  While the specific educational sessions and workshops are up to each node, we recommend including the following for beginners:
* Blockchain 101
* The Cryptocurrency Ecosystem
* Smart Contracts Workshop
* Blockchain Law & Policy

We encourage you to find local experts to teach sessions in your node, but would be happy to make available educational resources if you do not have local experts in your community.

**STREAM 2: HACK** 
Each node of the Computational Law & Blockchain Festival will take part in our Global Challenge, a distributed, 24-hour hackathon that challenges participants to build open-source solutions in two substantive tracks:
* Smart Contracts Challenge: This track asks participants to use open-source tools to build smart legal contracts addressing a range of common use cases and legal needs.
* Blockchain for Legal Use Cases: This track asks participants to build blockchain-based tools for legal use cases, including digital identity, open legal data, fundraising, and more.

Hackathon participants will submit their solutions to a global repository for judging, with an opportunity for local and global awards and prizes for winning solutions.

For those not taking part in the Global Challenge, the Festival will also enable participants to take part in Partner Challenges, which ask participants to contribute to ongoing projects based on existing code. We will have more information on Partner Challenges soon.

**STREAM 3: DISCUSS**
Each note of the Computational Law & Blockchain Festival will take part in a Global Symposium addressing five core policy areas (and two questions within each) related to blockchain technologies and cryptocurrencies:
* Taxation
* Securities regulation
* Anti-money laundering
* Privacy & security
* International money transfers

Each node will gather lawyers, policymakers, technologists, academics, and enthusiasts for a discussion of these issues, with the goal of contributing to a free and open global survey of those policy issues.

## Host a Node

### General Information

Want to host a Festival Node? Great! We’re here to help. Hosting a festival node requires advanced planning and coordination to be successful. Consider reaching out to potential hosts as soon as possible. A successful node will have the following characteristics:

**Venue:** A location that can accommodate the expected number of attendees, with at least 3 rooms--one for each module.  Rooms should have tables and chairs that enable learning, discussion, and collaboration, as well as power outlets for charging devices.  Great event spaces could include: universities, co-working spaces, corporate offices, law firms, and dedicated community event spaces.

**Audio/Visual:** Great equipment is key to a successful node. Nodes should have A/V for presenters and Q&A (e.g., microphones, PA system, projector, screen) and A/V to record presentations to post online.
Connectivity: All nodes should provide free Wi-Fi connectivity for participants in order to allow participants to collaborate and share their hacks and ideas.

**Refreshments:** Nodes should provide adequate refreshments for attendees, including coffee/tea and snacks. If nodes do not also provide meals, there should be adequate time and nearby options for participants to buy their own food.
Code of Conduct: To ensure a welcoming and safe environment for all participants, a successful node will have a Code of Conduct regarding appropriate and inappropriate behavior during the Festival, with consequences for violations of the code.

**Volunteers:** A team to help with event setup and breakdown; participant sign-in; food and drinks; coordinating speakers; and answering questions. Consider having one volunteer for every 10 participants.

**Sponsors:** Hosting a weekend festival will require some institutional sponsors to help cover the costs of the event. If a sponsor is unable to provide monetary support, consider asking if they would be willing to provide venue space or “in-kind” contributions.
Partners: Don’t go it alone! Consider partnering with like-minded meetups, universities, and corporate partners to make your node as successful as it can be.

**Local awards:** Celebrate your local winners with awards and prizes!
